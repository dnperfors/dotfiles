# My dotfiles

## Installation on new systems

In order to install these dotfiles the following steps need to be taken:

- Clone the repository to `~/.dotfiles`
- Run `.dotfiles/bootstrap/install.sh`

## Inspiration

Large parts are not from myself, but taken from other dotfiles.

* The bootstrap is taken from / inspired by the bootstrap script of [rambleraptor](https://github.com/rambleraptor/dotfiles)
